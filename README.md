# Laravel HTTPS redirection
This package aims to redirect your HTTP requests to HTTPS very simply.

## Installation

*NB: This package has not been tested below Laravel 5.5*


First, use the function below:

```
composer require winxaito/laravel-https
```

If you don't use auto-discovery, add the ServiceProvider to the providers 
array in `config/app.php`

```php
WinXaito\LaravelHttpsRedirect\LaravelHttpsServiceProvider::class,
```

If you want to work with the configurations without going through an environment 
file, run the following command and then edit the `config/https-redirection.php` 
file

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="WinXaito\LaravelHttpsRedirect\LaravelHttpsServiceProvider"
```

## How to use it ?

This package works with environment variables in order of priority.  
List of constants in order of priority:

- `HTTPS_FORCE`: If this value is true, then in all cases the requests will be 
redirected to *HTTPS*, otherwise we go to the following constant:
- `HTTPS_PROHIBIT`: If this constant is true, the queries will not be redirected, 
if it is false, then we go to the following constant:
- `APP_ENV`: If this constant is *production*, then we redirect to *HTTPS*, 
otherwise we go to the following constant:
- `APP_DEBUG`: If the application is not in debug mode, it is redirected to 
*HTTPS*, unless *HTTPS_PROHIBIT* is true. If the application is in debug mode 
then the address will not be redirected.


By default if no environment variable is defined we have the following values:

- `HTTPS_FORCE = false`
- `HTTPS_PROHIBIT = false`
- `APP_ENV = production`
- `APP_DEBUG = false`

Therefore by default the redirection is enabled.
